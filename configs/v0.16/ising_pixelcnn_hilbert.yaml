# v0.16 Compact PixelCNN with Hilbert Curve Path
#
# Goal: Improved 2D locality by sampling along Hilbert space-filling curve.
#
# Key features:
# - Hilbert curve: preserves 2D locality (adjacent samples are spatial neighbors)
# - Standard MaskedConv2D (raster masking) - only sampling ORDER changes
# - 4-layer Compact Dilated ResNet (same as compact config)
# - May improve learning of local correlations at critical temperature
#
# Hilbert curve property:
#   Adjacent positions in the sequence are neighbors in 2D space.
#   This is optimal for preserving locality when linearizing a 2D grid.
#
# Note: This is an EXPERIMENTAL mode. The network uses raster masking
# while sampling follows Hilbert order. This means the autoregressive
# factorization is not perfectly aligned with the sampling order.
# Use for testing locality effects on critical temperature learning.
